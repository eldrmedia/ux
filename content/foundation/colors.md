Use focused, meaningful color to pinpoint exactly what people need to see. We are committed to complying with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines AA standard contrast ratios](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). To do this, choose primary, secondary, and extended colors that support usability by ensuring sufficient color contrast between elements so that people with low vision can see and use our products.

## Primary palette
Our primary palette is comprised of neutrals, white, and pink to bring boldness and fun to our brand and is used in logical ways throughout product and marketing to guide the eye and highlight the important bits.

Use pink for primary actions, buttons, text links, for indicating progress and representing authentication. Black is used primarily for body text and headings, and white is used for page backgrounds.

<div class="row">
{{< colorswatch 
    color="primary"
    name="Pink"
    variable="$primary"
    hex="#ec008c"
    rgb="263 0 140"
    >}}

{{< colorswatch 
    color="secondary"
    name="Violet"
    variable="$secondary"
    hex="#702c91"
    rgb="111 44 154"
    >}}

{{< colorswatch 
    color="dark"
    name="Black"
    variable="$dark"
    hex="#000"
    rgb="0 0 0"
    >}}
</div>

## Secondary palette
Our secondary palette contains a variety of colors to keep things fresh and interesting. We lean on these colors more frequently when brand awareness is high, or on our own properties where we control the surrounding environment. When used in conjunction with our primary palette, these colors make every moment feel on-brand and every interaction informative.

## Extended palette
The extended palette consists of all the useable tints and shades of each color in the palette. Usage of these colors varies depending on the touch point, but they come in handy for backgrounds, illustrations and components in products.

### Danger
Red is mainly used for backgrounds in messages and in error states to draw attention to important information or actions that are destructive or block workflow. You'll find red used in components such as badges, alerts, buttons, icons, and typography.

<div class="row">
{{< colorswatch
    color="danger"
    name="Danger"
    variable="$danger"
    hex="#f71b13"
    rgb="247 27 19"
    >}}
</div>


### Warning
Yellow indicates a warning or that progress is impeded. Yellow feels right at home in components such as badges, alerts and buttons.

<div class="row">
{{< colorswatch
    color="warning"
    name="Warning"
    variable="$warning"
    hex="#FFAB00"
    rgb="255 171 0"
    >}}
</div>


### Green
We use green to indicate success or to celebrate a win. Green goes well with badges, toggles, alerts, and icons. Keep in mind that green is very vibrant, which can cause eye strain in large doses. However, because of this vibrancy, it can also stand out well among many other elements on a page, which is why it is a good choice for calls-to-action and buttons in marketing.

<div class="row">
{{< colorswatch
    color="success"
    name="Success"
    variable="$success"
    hex="#00853C"
    rgb="0 133 60"
    >}}
</div>


## Semantic color
The following guidelines outline when to use colors in products. Semantic color helps users identify status, see actions, locate help, and understand next steps. The consistent use of color keeps cognitive load low and makes for a unified and engaging user experience.
