Icons should be used in a purposeful manner to maximize comprehension and reduce cognitive load when you need to call attention to a particular action, command, or section. Use them infrequently – if you’re questioning an icon’s use, it probably doesn’t need to be used at all. 

As a general rule, icons should be used in combination with meaningful text to support users progressing through the product in an accessible manner. However, avoid aria-labels if you are rendering the icon with visible text to prevent accessibility label duplication.

Find out more about writing meaningful text in our [accessibility guidelines](/foundation/accessibility/).

Combining unfamiliar icons with text could confuse users depending on how they recognize the supporting icon, so make sure the icon and text label are coupled. To help enhance usability further, ensure the icon color has at least a [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standard color contrast ratio](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

Avoid using icons solely for decoration or visual interest as it detracts from their intention elsewhere. Consider the surrounding context of icons too; if icons are cluttered and not spaced well, it can lead to more visual noise and confusion.

Icons can represent a single concept such as + which always represents ‘add’, or be thematic in concept such as ☆ which might represent "favorite", "like", "star" etc. Using an icon appropriately allows our users to create a connection to a concept, so don’t over-extend what an icon represents.

## Internationalization

Always consider icons from a global perspective. Whenever possible, use an internationally recognized icon in place of a locally recognized icon that may only apply to a specific background or culture such as a local currency symbol, € ¥ £, rather than always using $.
