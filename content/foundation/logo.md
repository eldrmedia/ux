The Roll20 font was customized for the logotype. **DO NOT** attempt to reset. I will find you if you do. While there are both horizontal and vertical options of the mark, the horizontal configuration is preferred. When used together in the horizontal configuration, the logotype is shown with the registered trademark (®) symbol. Uniform use of the Roll20 mark logo builds awareness in the gaming community and beyond. The Roll20 mark should be used in accordance in the approved artwork guidelines. No attempt should be made to alter the artwork beyond what is provided. In all usages, please ensure there is a comfortable amount of clear space around the logo.

## Color Standards

The colors used in the Roll20 mark help make it a distinguishable element of the brand’s identity. It is important to be consistent in the use of color. Do not use the purple monochrome version without express approval from the Brand Manager. If you're looking for more color codes, see the [Primary Palette](/foundation/colors/#primary-palette).
